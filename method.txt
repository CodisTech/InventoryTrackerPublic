# Docker Update Method

After committing changes to Git, follow these steps to update Docker:

1. Build the new Docker image:
```
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

2. Stop and remove existing containers:
```
docker-compose down
```

3. Start the updated containers:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Verify the containers are running:
```
docker-compose ps
```

5. Check logs for any errors:
```
docker-compose logs
```

The changes should now be deployed with the new password change functionality working in the Docker environment.
