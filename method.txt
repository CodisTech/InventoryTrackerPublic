# Print Functionality Implementation Method

## Overview
The automatic print functionality was implemented across both single and multi-item checkout workflows to provide a seamless experience for users who need physical records of transactions.

## Key Components

### 1. Automatic Print Dialog

- Used React's window.print() API triggered from useEffect after modal open

### 2. Print Layout Design
- Created a specialized CSS print layout using @media print queries
- Hid navigation elements and UI controls during printing
- Designed a receipt-style format with clear headers and structured information

### 3. Transaction Receipt Content

  - Item name, category, and identification code
  - Serial numbers and inventory specifics
  - Quantity being checked out
- Included personnel information for accountability:
  - Name, ID, department, and division
  - Contact details for follow-up
- Added timestamps and due dates for return tracking
- Included signature lines for physical record verification

### 4. Implementation Consistency

### 5. Error Handling
