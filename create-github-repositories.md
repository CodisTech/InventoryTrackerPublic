# Creating GitHub Repositories for Inventory Management System

To complete the setup of all three repository types, you'll need to manually create two additional GitHub repositories:

1. **Public Repository**:
   - Repository Name: `InventoryTrackerPublic`
   - Visibility: Public
   - Description: "Public version of Inventory Management System with limited features"
   - Initialize with README: No

2. **Sandbox Repository**:
   - Repository Name: `InventoryTrackerSandbox`
   - Visibility: Private
   - Description: "Sandbox environment for testing Inventory Management System features"
   - Initialize with README: No

## Steps to Create These Repositories

1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Click the "+" icon in the upper right and select "New repository"
3. Fill in the repository name as indicated above
4. Add the description
5. Choose the appropriate visibility setting (public/private)
6. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
7. Click "Create repository"

## After Creating the Repositories

After you've created both repositories, you'll need to set them up as remotes in your local repository:

```bash
# For the public repository
git remote add public https://github.com/your-username/InventoryTrackerPublic.git

# For the sandbox repository
git remote add sandbox https://github.com/your-username/InventoryTrackerSandbox.git
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

Then run the synchronization script:

```bash
./sync-repositories.sh "Initial commit for all repository types"
```

This will push all the code to all three repositories with the proper repository type configuration set for each.
