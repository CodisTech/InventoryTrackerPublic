# Creating GitHub Repositories for Inventory Management System

I've detected that the remote repositories are already configured in git, but the actual repositories need to be created on GitHub. 

## Step 1: Create repositories on GitHub

To complete the setup of all three repository types, you'll need to create two additional GitHub repositories:

1. **Public Repository**:
   - Repository Name: `InventoryTrackerPublic`
   - Organization/Owner: `codistech` (matches existing remotes)
   - Visibility: Public
   - Description: "Public version of Inventory Management System with limited features"
   - Initialize with README: No

2. **Sandbox Repository**:
   - Repository Name: `InventoryTrackerSandbox`
   - Organization/Owner: `codistech` (matches existing remotes)
   - Visibility: Private
   - Description: "Sandbox environment for testing Inventory Management System features"
   - Initialize with README: No

## Step 2: Create the repositories on GitHub

1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Go to https://github.com/organizations/codistech/repositories/new (if using organization) or https://github.com/new (if personal account)
3. Fill in the repository name as indicated above
4. Add the description
5. Choose the appropriate visibility setting (public/private)
6. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
7. Click "Create repository"
8. Repeat for the second repository

## Step 3: Push to the repositories

Once both repositories are created, you can use the sync-repositories.sh script to push to all three repositories:

```bash
# Make sure we're on the main branch
git checkout main

# Run the sync script with your commit message
./sync-repositories.sh "Initial setup for all repository types"
```

This will:
1. Switch to each repository type (private, public, sandbox)
2. Update the feature flags and repository indicator files
3. Commit the changes
4. Push to the appropriate remote
5. Return to the original repository type

## Step 4: Verify the repository setup

After pushing to all repositories, you can verify that each has the correct repository type set:

1. Clone the public repository to a temporary location
2. Check that `.repository-type` contains "public"
3. Verify that advanced features are disabled in the UI

Repeat similar checks for the private and sandbox repositories as needed.
